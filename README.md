# Praxis

The idea behind praxis is to take some good ideas form Elixir's ecto, and turn them into a library useful for validating forms, automatically rendering them as HTML (with a few default options, as well as ways to override rendering entirely), and to make it easy to scaffold out web servers interacting with Schema'd data.

# Status

Praxis is still very much in the "still just an idea and some exploration" stage.
